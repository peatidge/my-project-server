--view current location of HEAD
 cd .git
 get-content HEAD
 get-content refs/heads/master
 --git diff (view changes)
 git diff
 git diff --staged (staged files only)
 --undo changes (git checkout)
 git checkout -- server.js (checkout specific file in the current branch *note -- indicates the current working branch)
 git reset HEAD server.js (unstage staged file(s), after unstaging use git checkout to reset back to remote repository current head)
 --amend commits
 first add changes to staged (git add)
 then run command
 git commit --amend -m "updated commit messaged"
 *NOTE: git only allows amending the most recent commit (edits which undo changes should be a new commit)
 --view commit 
 git show [sha]
 --revert a commit
 git revert [sha]
 --ancestry (to get a parent commit use the caret ^ ) e.g. 
 de14621f^ (by sha)
 HEAD ^ (by HEAD)
 master^ (by branch)
 --to show grandparent add another caret e.g.
 HEAD^^
 --or use the tilde ~ with a number as short hand e.g.
 HEAD~1 (parent)
 HEAD~2 (grandparent)
 HEAD~3 (great grand parent)
 git show master~3
 --to view a tree (list files [hash for a tree])
git ls-tree master (by branch)
git ls-tree [sha] (by commit)
--show branches
git branch
--create a new branch
git branch name_of_my_new_branch
*NOTE: head is still pointing to the exiting branch i.e. view 
--view head refs 
dir .\.git\refs\heads\
get-content ./.git/refs/heads/master
get-content ./.git/refs/heads/name_of_my_new_branch
*NOTE both are pointing to the same commit in the master branch
--switch to another branch
git checkout name_of_my_new_branch
--merge branch (first step is to checkout the branch you are going to merge into *this is good practice to ensure you have the latest remote verson)
git checkout master
--then run the merge command to bring in
git merge 

--then run the merge command (this is known as a fast-forward merge because the master branch had not changed)
git merge name_of_my_new_branch

--if there is a merge conflict the conflicts need to be resolved
git status (view status of merge)
--you can abort the merge
git merge --abort
--or resolve conflicts by going to the actual files and updating the conflict to the target state of the file
git show --color-words
--and then resolve the conflicts manually in the file
--use git merge tool
git mergetool
--resolve changes and then use command :wqa to save changes
--after this run a new commit and use git push/pull
